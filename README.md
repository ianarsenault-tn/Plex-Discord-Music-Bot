## 🛡️ Security Tips
1.	Environment Variables:
Store sensitive information (Plex and Discord tokens) in a .env file. Never hardcode these in your code.
2.	Restrict Access:
Ensure your Plex server is only accessible to authorized users.
3.	.gitignore:
Add .env to .gitignore to prevent accidental sharing of sensitive information.
